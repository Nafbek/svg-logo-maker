  ## Description
  This SVG Logo Maker is a command-line application that generates a logo in svg format based on the user's input. Users are prompted to answer questions to customize the feature of the logo. Once the user has entered input for all the prompts, and the length of the logo name is not higher than 3, the logo.svg file will be generated. The application uses Node.js and the inquirer module for user input.

 
  ## Installation
  In order to use this application, make sure to have Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm) on your local machine. Clone the repository, open the root directory of the application on your terminal, and run the command <npm install> to install any required dependecies. This application does not require any other installation otherwise.

  ## Usage
  Open the root directory of the application, and run a command <node index.js> in your terminal. You will be then prompted to questions about your logo. Press the 'Enter' key to proceed to the next question. Once you have answered the prompts, your logo.svg file will be generated in the `lib` directory.
